        <p class="fs-3 mb-0">
         The Prime Korean Language and Review Center Incorporated is the result of Jonwel Suprecencia's firsthand experience as an EPS worker in South Korea. Through his early endeavors, Jonwel recognized the crucial need for Filipinos working abroad to acquire a strong foundation in the Korean language as part of their employment requirements. He gained a deep understanding of the disparities between Filipino and Korean cultures and developed a comprehensive knowledge of Korean Labor and Immigration Laws. <br>
Originally known as CHOGI LANGUAGE AND TECHNOLOGY CENTER INC., our corporation now operates under the name Prime Korean Language and Review Center and Asian Korean Language andReview Center (formerly: Chogi Language and Technology Center Inc.) as amended on January 09, 2021.<br>
Prime Korean Language and Review Center is a language training center dedicated to providing intensive Korean language training to help individuals pass the Korean language test mandated by HRDKOREA (Human Resources Development of Korea) in coordination with POEA (Philippine Overseas Employment Administration). Since our establishment in 2018, we have been registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under registration no. CS201817522.<br>
We are committed to assisting Filipinos in passing the Korean language proficiency test by providing support. Our comprehensive guidance helps students/applicants fulfill the step-by-step requirements necessary to qualify as factory workers in South Korea. With our excellent Korean language training services, we empower Filipino workers to excel in the EPS-TOPIK exam administered by POEA.<br>

        <p class="lead mb-5">
            At the Prime Korean Language and Review Center, we take immense pride in being recognized as one of the best Korean language learning centers in the Philippines. Our primary objective is to help individuals achieve a progressive future by mastering the Korean language. Through our comprehensive programs, students can become fluent speakers, improve their listening skills, and enhance their writing and reading abilities. Additionally, we provide dedicated assistance to Filipinosaiming to pass the EPS-TOPIK exam, opening doors for employment as factory workers in South Korea.

            <h3 class="h1 mb-4 text-dark">What is eps-topik?
            </h3>
            <p class="lead mb-5">
                EPS-TOPIK stands for Employment Permit System-Test of Proficiency in Korean. It is a pure Korean language test implemented by HRD Korea and POEA to mitigate the presence of irregular workers in South Korea.
	    </p>
            <p class="lead mb-5">
                It is important to note that there are no longer any agencies involved in the process of working in South Korea. Only POEA can provide you with an employer if you successfully pass their EPS-TOPIK examination. Prime Korean Language and Review Center is not an agency but a dedicated Korean language training center.
            </p>
            <p class="lead mb-5">
                Our corporation operates in compliance with Philippine laws and regulations and is one of the leading language service providers operating in Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. Presently, we have seven branches actively serving enrollees in Cebu City, Mandaue City, Tagbilaran City, Bohol, Tacloban City, Calbayog City, Puerto Princesa City, Palawan, and Butuan City.
