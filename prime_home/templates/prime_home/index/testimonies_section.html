We also inform our clients that only the Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) has the authority to facilitate their departure to South Korea. Through our orientations, we provide step-by-step guidance on the application process for working in South Korea, empowering our clients with the necessary information to navigate the journey ahead.</p>

Our aim is to alleviate the financial burden and provide a smooth transition for our students, empowering them to embark on their journey with confidence and peace of mind.
